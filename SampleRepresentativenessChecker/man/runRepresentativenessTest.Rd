\alias{runRepresentativenessTest}
\title{Runs the Equivalence Hypothesis Test with the null of non-representativeness for a fixed sample size.
This makes use of the package \code{MultinomialCI} which is based on the method of Sison & Glaz (1995).}
\usage{
runRepresentativenessTest(pi, x, delta, alpha = 0.05, illustrate = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{pi}{The true, gold-standard probabilities which defines the population characteristics
on d cells and is thus of length d.
We are testing against this to ascertain if the sample is representative.}

\item{x}{The experimental sample consisting of a count vector of length d.}

\item{delta}{The practical equivalence tolerance level. This can be a scalar (implying
a d-length vector with the same value) or a vector of length d.}

\item{alpha}{The minimum Type I error rate (test size). Default is \code{5\%}.}

\item{illustrate}{Should the d cells be illustrated as a bar plot showing pi +- delta with
the p-hat sample and its confidence interval? Default is code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A list which contains function arguments as well as the following keys: 
							(a) reject_null - a boolean which indicates
							if the non-representativeness null was rejected
							(b) ci - this is the simultaneous confidence interval for the
							multinomial sample proportion vector as a d x 2 matrix 
							(c) pval - the significance level for the test
							(d) conventional_null_chisq - the chi-squared value for the 
							conventional goodness-of-fit test
							(e) conventional_null_pval - the significance level based on
							the conventional goodness-of-fit test
